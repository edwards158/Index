# My Github Landing Page

This page contains links to my repos.  These jupyter notebooks contain some of my work in data science and machine learning.  Most of my work uses python and relevant libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, keras etc. Recently I have begun developing in Apache Spark and PostgreSQL.  Please follow the links below:
